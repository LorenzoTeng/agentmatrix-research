jq_gm — JointQuant GM Factor Library for AgentMatrix Research.

Factors adapted from the JoinQuant factor board taxonomy, independently
implemented via the GM (掘金) SDK. 215 non-Alpha factors across 10
categories (basic, quality, momentum, growth, sentiment, per-share,
risk, technical indicators, and sub-categories).

=== Integration with factor_lab ===

This module follows the same pattern as libraries/alpha101 and
libraries/gtja191:

  specs.py    — FactorResearchSpec declarations (215 factors)
  factors.py  — compute engine wrapping gm_factor_lib.calc_factors()
  test_factors.py — unit tests for spec validity and compute routing

Every factor registered here passes through the standard factor_lab
pipeline: Spec → compute → proof-batch → validation report.

=== Note on GM SDK dependency ===

The compute engine requires the GM (掘金) SDK and a valid GM terminal
session.  In environments without GM SDK, the engine falls back to
stub mode (empty DataFrames) — sufficient for CI validation of the
pipeline, but not for numerical correctness checks.  See factors.py
for details.
