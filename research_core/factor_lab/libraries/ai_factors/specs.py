"""AI-generated factor library — price/technical factors from OHLCV data.

Unlike jq_gm (which requires GM SDK for financial statement data),
ai_factors computes everything from OHLCV panel data using pandas.
No external API needed.

Factors are registered at runtime via expression_to_spec() from
mining_bridge.  The spec list grows as LLM-generated factors pass
structural check + IC evaluation.
